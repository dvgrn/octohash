The octohash databases are big enough that they make the b3s23life repository very unwieldy.  Moving to a new separate repository, 13 October 2020.

Removed the lifelib versions after moving, since the database files are larger and require an unnecessary dependency on lifelib for no added benefit.  These files can be recovered from the repo history if necessary, but it should also be possible to download a ZIP file of current octohash contents without going to the expense of cloning the entire repository.

1/26/2021:  checked in a series of scripts used to generate the octohash database.  These can be adapted to fingerprint all phases of other collision collections, e.g., the 3G/4G database.  I plan to update this README with a walkthrough of the full process of generating a new octohash database, whenever I get around to fingerprinting wildmyron's version of the 3G/4G SJK database (duplicates removed by using canonical Shinjuku glider-collision format to store the 3G and 4G collisions.)
